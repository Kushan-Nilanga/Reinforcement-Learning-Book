# Dynamic Programming 
Dynamic programming is sequential or temporal method of optimising a ```policy``` 

By using dynamic programming,
- We can solve complex problems
- Break down complex problems to sub problems and solve them

In order for dynamic programming solution to exist
- There should be an optimal substructure - Means that this is infact can be solved by solving the subproblems.
